# CV
I got tired of having several version of my CV, so I decided to put everything here :) (version control). My CV is built using a [free template](http://www.LaTeXTemplates.com) in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).

To see my CV just click on the [*.pdf file](https://github.com/adrHuerta/CV/blob/master/ahuerta_cv.pdf) or by [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/rcsfvcxtrgbz) - Spanish version.
If you want to check the English pdf version, just click [here](https://github.com/adrHuerta/CV/blob/master/ahuerta_cv_e.pdf).
